          <h4>Align data with problems</h4>
          <p>Data are powerful. They encode our systemic beliefs and biases. Solving a problem with data requires finding a representative sample.</p>
          <div class="w3-mobile w3-container" style="max-width:300px;">
            <div class="w3-border w3-padding">

              <div class="w3-container">How do we make sure this pile is not garbage? </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>There is a story from the 1950s film ‚ÄúRashomon‚Äù about how different observers can have contradictory views of the same event. Each perspective is plausible but none of them are quite real, because of individual bias and prior belief.</p>
          <p>So, I work to ensure that the data represent the question at hand and can provide an accurate prediction.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Example:</i> I‚Äôve identified an approach to train a large language model to read and extract structured data from inbound sales emails at flyExclusive. Then, I supervised curating and labeling the samples and trained the model.

          <h4>Automate data generation</h4>
          <p>Prediction systems can support or substitute human labor. Deploying successful data pipelines requires considering and designing for the people who will use the system.</p>
          <div class="w3-mobile w3-container" style="max-width:300px;">
            <div class="w3-border w3-padding">
              <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Luddite.jpg" width="100%">
              <div class="w3-container">The Luddites asked for a voice in automation</div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>We need to think about who contributes to, is impacted by, and benefits from automation. As an example, the Luddite movement began by mill workers being disenfranchised by imposed automation. A start to ensuring alignment is to ask people what they want. From there, we can co-create solutions that solve stakeholder problems.</p>
          <p>So, I work to ensure that the people involved in data work are a part of the solution.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Example:</i> I‚Äôve built a system that extracts, transforms, and loads email data into a low-code Airtable interface for further processing by experts at flyExclusive, giving the team the power to more easily scan through their data while maintaining control over the following steps.

          <h4>Assess model predictions</h4>
          <p>All models are wrong. They are reduced representations of the world that allow us to predict the future.</p>
          <div class="w3-mobile w3-container" style="max-width:300px;">
            <div class="w3-border w3-padding">
              <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg" width="100%">
              <div class="w3-container">This is not a pipe</div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>There is a logical fallacy, highlighted by philosopher Alfred Korzybski, of mistaking the map for the territory. Since the map is not the territory, predictions from the model will never be a 1:1 representation of the truth. A way around this fallacy is to understand where the model is wrong.</p>
          <p>So, I work to measure the inaccuracy of the predictions that come from data pipelines and models that I build.</p>
          <p>
            <i>Example:</i> I‚Äôve continuously monitored predictive errors from a machine learning model that I built to predict flight times between any two places in the US at flyExclusive.
