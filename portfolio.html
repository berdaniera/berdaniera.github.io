      <h3 class="display-4">Case study 1: La Vita Yoga</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-9">
          <p class="lead"><a href="https://www.lavitayoga.com">La Vita Yoga</a> is a streaming video web application for a yoga studio in Durham, North Carolina. It was built to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and help the studio move online.</p>
          <p><img src="img/lvy.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

          
          <p>As the product lead, I developed the application to meet two primary user needs:<br>
          <ol><li>remotely access a subscription video library and,</li> 
            <li>register and pay for live yoga classes. </li></ol>
I gathered design input from the studio owner and talked to yoga students to understand their points of friction. For the initial prototype we developed a manual process, including: 
        <ul><li>handling payment through Stripe, </li>
          <li>granting on-demand video access through Vimeo, and </li>
          <li>manually emailing Zoom class links to students. </li></ul>
This prototype and interviews with over 40 users led to the development of a web application that automated each of these steps and made browsing videos and registering for classes easier. 
        Additional experiments that were ultimately removed include: a referral program, Spotify audio along with videos, and a “plus” subscription with expert guides.
</p>

<p>Early user feedback:
<ul><li>“I tried to think of some good critical feedback for you, but overall, I'm very impressed by the creativity of your website, and different online yoga ideas.”</li>
  <li>“Jessica's website is great.” </li>
  <li>“Beautiful layout.” </li>
  <li>“Love the videos and think this is such a great resource!“</li>
  </ul>

      <h3 class="display-4">Case study 2: TransLoc OnDemand</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-9">
          <p class="lead">TransLoc OnDemand is an administrative application that powers the “microtransit” portion of the <a href="https://transloc.com/app/">TransLoc mobile application</a>. In this system transit riders book trips through the TransLoc mobile application, which TransLoc processes and dispatches to public transit agency vehicle drivers.</p>

<p>As a product manager, my focus was on improving the rider experience for the existing applications. 
  I worked with public transit agency buyers to understand their trip scheduling needs (balancing wait times with the number of vehicles in service). 
  Then, I clustered rider/user feedback from the mobile application (thousands of users) to prioritize their concerns.</p>

<p>As part of a cross-functional product team of software engineers and product designers, we used these inputs to iteratively develop multiple consumer-facing capabilities, including:
<ul><li>Indicators in the mobile application for the expected drop-off window (pre-request, shown at right) and expected wait time (pre-confirmation) to help riders make a more informed trip decision.</li>
  <li>Routing optimization to make vehicle routing more efficient (reducing vehicle miles/cost) and reduce rider wait and ride times.</li>
<li>Dispatcher prioritization capabilities to reconcile customer support of trips that need urgent attention.</li>
<li>Administrator “hub” points to support trips that connect to or from other modes of transit and highlight those locations for riders.</li>
